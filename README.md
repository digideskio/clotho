This project is based on mcmodify, but fixes a few problems with the parser and
adds a map making capability. Given a save game directory, it will scan the
upper world region files and produce a PNG of the known world. The world is
marked with a grid and the coordinates in the game to enable you to find a
particular location.

Clotho is the name of the youngest Greek Fate that spun the cloth of destiny.

Building:
1. install java 7 and maven 3.
2. Use "mvn package" to build the jars
